                                                                </h3>
								<p class="pad_bot1 color2">The MLS stands for Multiple Listing Service. The MLS is a collection of real estate properties for a given area. This collection takes the form of an electronic database, which is updated with new entries and/or information on properties.  It is considered the most comprehensive source of information for buyers and sellers of real estate. MLS listings detail essential information about a property; like, address, offering price, the number and size of rooms, annual property taxes, local schools and selling agent. Photos of the home are usually attached to the file.</p>
